## Next Steps

You can now:

- Review the plans - Each plan is detailed and self-contained
- Choose where to begin - I recommend following the coordination plan's sequence:
  - Week 1: Environment Management + Architecture Implementation
  - Week 2: Ansible Orchestration + System Configuration
  - Week 3: Integration and Testing
  - Week 4: Documentation and Release
- Start implementation - Each plan has specific tasks with clear deliverables and testing criteria
