# Notes

This was the recommndation of the AI agent on the execution order.

## Next Steps

You can now:

- Review the plans - Each plan is detailed and self-contained
- Choose where to begin - I recommend following the coordination plan's sequence:
  - Week 1: Environment Management + Architecture Implementation
  - Week 2: Ansible Orchestration + System Configuration
  - Week 3: Integration and Testing
  - Week 4: Documentation and Release
- Start implementation - Each plan has specific tasks with clear deliverables and testing criteria

## Packages

These are all packages that I installed manually because I was too impatient to do it all in playbooks. They should eventually be installed using the playbooks.

- docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
- cockpit, cockpit-podman, cockpit-networkmanager
