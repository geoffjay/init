# PRD: System Configuration

## Overview
The system configuration component handles OS-level setup, package installation, shell configuration, and system customizations to create a fully functional development environment.

## Objectives
- Configure zsh as the default shell with optimal settings
- Install essential development tools and utilities
- Apply OS-specific optimizations and configurations
- Ensure consistent experience across different platforms

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR-1: Shell Configuration
- **Requirement**: Configure zsh as default shell with enhanced functionality
- **Implementation**:
  - Install zsh on all supported systems
  - Set zsh as user's default shell
  - Configure zsh with sensible defaults
  - Install and configure shell enhancements
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - zsh is installed and set as default shell
  - Shell starts with proper configuration
  - Command history, completion, and aliases work
  - Shell integrates with environment management (asdf, direnv)

#### FR-2: Development Tools Installation
- **Requirement**: Install essential development tools via package managers
- **Tool Categories**:
  - Version control: git, git-lfs
  - Text editors: vim, nano
  - System utilities: curl, wget, unzip, tar
  - Development utilities: build-essential, cmake
  - Network tools: ssh, rsync
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - All tools installed via native package managers
  - Tools work correctly after installation
  - Platform-specific variations handled appropriately

#### FR-3: OS-Specific Configuration
- **Requirement**: Apply platform-specific optimizations and settings
- **Linux Configuration**:
  - Update package manager cache
  - Install platform-specific utilities
  - Configure system services as needed
- **macOS Configuration**:
  - Install Xcode command line tools
  - Configure Homebrew
  - Set macOS-specific preferences
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Platform detection works correctly
  - OS-specific tasks only run on appropriate systems
  - System optimizations improve user experience

#### FR-4: Package Manager Optimization
- **Requirement**: Optimize package manager configuration and usage
- **Linux (apt)**:
  - Configure apt repositories
  - Set up package preferences
  - Enable universe repositories where needed
- **Linux (apk)**:
  - Configure Alpine package repositories
  - Install apk-tools optimizations
- **macOS (brew)**:
  - Configure Homebrew taps
  - Set up Cask for GUI applications
  - Optimize Homebrew performance
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Package installations are fast and reliable
  - All necessary repositories are configured
  - Package manager settings are optimized

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR-1: Idempotent Configuration
- All configuration tasks can be run multiple times safely
- Existing configurations are detected and preserved where appropriate
- No destructive changes to existing user settings

#### NFR-2: User Experience
- Shell provides modern, efficient command-line experience
- Auto-completion and syntax highlighting work
- Command history is preserved and searchable
- Minimal configuration required from user

#### NFR-3: Performance
- Shell starts quickly (< 2 seconds)
- Package installations are efficient
- System remains responsive during configuration

## Configuration Components

### Shell Configuration
```
~/.zshrc                 # Main zsh configuration
~/.zsh/                  # Custom zsh configurations
├── aliases.zsh          # Command aliases
├── completion.zsh       # Custom completions
├── history.zsh          # History configuration
└── prompt.zsh           # Prompt customization
```

### Package Lists

#### Common Tools (All Platforms)
- git, curl, wget, vim, nano, unzip, tar, ssh, rsync

#### Linux-Specific (apt)
- build-essential, cmake, software-properties-common, apt-transport-https

#### Linux-Specific (apk)
- alpine-sdk, cmake, ca-certificates

#### macOS-Specific (brew)
- Xcode command line tools, gnu-sed, gnu-tar, coreutils

## Platform Support Matrix

| Feature | Debian/Ubuntu | Alpine | macOS |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| zsh Installation | apt | apk | brew |
| Package Management | apt | apk | brew |
| Shell Configuration | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Development Tools | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| OS Optimization | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Integration Points

### Bootstrap Integration
- Bootstrap script installs package managers
- System ready for Ansible configuration

### Environment Management Integration
- Shell configuration works with asdf and direnv
- Environment variables properly sourced
- Tool versions automatically managed

### Ansible Implementation
- Use native Ansible modules for all configurations
- Leverage conditional tasks for platform differences
- Group related configuration tasks logically

## Dependencies
- Package managers (installed by bootstrap)
- Ansible (from Python virtual environment)  
- System permissions for shell and package management

## Success Metrics
- zsh configured and functional on 100% of supported systems
- All essential development tools available after configuration
- Shell startup time under 2 seconds
- No manual intervention required after Ansible completion
- Consistent experience across all supported platforms
